🔍 Recently, I worked on configuring EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) across a multi-router topology, ensuring seamless communication between networks. Here's a breakdown of my setup and key insights!

📌 Network Topology:
✔️ Four routers (Router0, Router1, Router2, Router3)
✔️ Serial interfaces connecting them in a redundant topology
✔️ Loopback interface on Router3 for testing connectivity

⚡ EIGRP Configuration (AS 100)
Each router was configured to advertise its networks while enabling EIGRP for dynamic routing:

bash
Copy
Edit
Router0(config)# router eigrp 100
Router0(config-router)# network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
Router0(config-router)# network 20.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
Router0(config-router)# no auto-summary
Similarly, I set up EIGRP on Router1, Router2, and Router3, ensuring optimal path selection and loop prevention.

🛠️ Verification & Troubleshooting
After setting up, I verified EIGRP neighbors and routes using:
✅ show ip eigrp neighbors
✅ show ip route eigrp
✅ show ip eigrp topology

Finally, I tested connectivity to Router3’s loopback (192.168.1.1) from other routers using:

bash
Copy
Edit
ping 192.168.1.1
🎯 Result: Full EIGRP convergence and successful end-to-end communication!

💡 Key Takeaways
🔹 EIGRP’s DUAL algorithm ensures fast convergence & loop-free routing
🔹 Using wildcard masks properly defines network boundaries
🔹 Loopback interfaces are great for testing and stability
